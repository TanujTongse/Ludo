    <h3>There Are Some Instructions & Rules</h3>
    <h4>
	<li>Select the number of players you want to play</li>
	<li>
	 Players take turns in a clockwise order; highest throw of the die starts.<br></li>
<li>Each throw, the player decides which piece to move.<br></li>
<li>A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track given by the number thrown.<br></li>
<li>If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next player.<br></li>
<li>A throw of 6 gives another turn.<br></li>
<li>A player must throw a 6 to move a piece from the starting circle onto the first square on the track.
<br></li>
<li> The piece moves 6 squares around the circuit beginning with the appropriately coloured start square (and the player then has another turn).<br></li>
<li>If a piece lands on a piece of a different colour, the piece jumped upon is returned to its starting circle.<br></li>
<li>If a piece lands upon a piece of the same colour, this forms a block. This block cannot be passed or landed on by any opposing piece.<br>
	</li>
	</ul>
